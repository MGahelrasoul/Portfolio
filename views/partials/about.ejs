        <div class="about-row">
            <div>
                <p class="lead animated">As a
                    skilled Web Developer with a background in object-oriented programming and full-stack web
                    development, I am confident that I have the technical expertise, communication skills, and
                    problem-solving abilities needed to excel in any role.
                </p>
                <p class="lead animated">In my previous positions, I have worked with various backend technologies such
                    as MongoDB, Express,and Node, as well as front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, Material UI, and
                    React. I have also gained experience in UI/UX design, Graphic Design, and Content Management
                    Systems. I've demonstrated my ability to develop web applications from scratch, from creating 
                    well-designed eCommerce websites compliant with design standards, to ensuring website security 
                    and cross-browser compatibility.
                </p>
                <p class="lead animated">I've always had a strong interest in Software Development and spent the past
                    few years
                    focused on Web Development. In my free time, I also enjoy digital design and art. As a
                    developer, my goal is to continue learning and growing, with the intention of expanding further
                    into UX/UI development. I am always eager to invest in new technologies and expand my skill
                    set.
                </p>
                <p class="lead animated">Developing is something that I am truly passionate about. I have spent countless hours
                    researching and improving myself, and I am confident in my ability to prove that I am a capable
                    addition to any team. My strong problem-solving skills and ability to work collaboratively make
                    me a valuable asset to any project.
